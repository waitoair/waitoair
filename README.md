## Hi there, I'm Luana :wave:

Hi, I'm a Brazilian software developer recently graduated from [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/), a programming bootcamp present in 45 cities, in 20 countries.

In this course I discovered my passion for programming and currently I'm working with Ruby on Rails and React and I'm really enjoying it, so I intend to improve myself in these technologies more and more. <br/>
I always start the day with good coffee â˜•
