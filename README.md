## Hi there, I'm Luana :wave:

Hi, I'm a Brazilian software developer recently graduated from [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/), a programming bootcamp present in 45 cities, in 20 countries.

In this course I discovered my passion for programming, more precisely Ruby on Rails, nowadays I start my day with a good coffee :coffee: and develop projects based on the knowledge from the course.
